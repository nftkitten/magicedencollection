Us Lucky Cats used to co-exist with humans in the past, living and working together in the same community. We thought everything was going well, it turns out that we were wrong, humans had been planning to wipe us out behind our backs. A long time ago, there was a global mission to wipe out all cats from existance. They nearly succeeded, but some of us managed to escape and hid underground, there were about 2222 of us remaining from the hundreds of millions global. Hence, we named ourselves the Lucky Cat Society because we believe we are the lucky ones. After the tragedy, we decided to stealthily make a kingdom, deep in the jungle where no human has ever found to this date. And now, we are ready to take back what’s ours.
