Each piece within this collection represents a moment of discovery from that process of extensive exploration – a gallery of landscape photographs from the parallel world of abstract mathematics.","creators":[{"address":"GdZVjytyPZv1jJA34rRs4SwXZxg8wQ7mL5eT3REryWcV","share":80,"verified":0},{"address":"pjGKdt8s3N9ueMamYGjNLAU54nXSFUpxdhWnahKMbAV","share":15,"verified":0},{"address":"EEU8j8ypEUyuin2zRazQH3bHSUEqezRMz6CXvpU7LGiJ","share":5,"verified":0}],"escrowPubkey":"9HxBymeDvheCJ1BT9N35AEMAUYRT3sqAVK4QYFn48weR","externalURL":"https://abstractlabs.art","id":"E83fCLNR8iDuhmwnzARFwmvoB8t2gGRC3WLi5Azv1x1V","img":"https://arweave.net/k9O2sDPmh0MAGBDtIgrZyoa_CxLibH9LyzyomtQS5Hc?ext=jpg","mintAddress":"GXwyufQwwLJFNkdvhucQNLxynerxU9VKkzxNj4eciygK","onChainCollection":{},"owner":"FGeQoJHQuKTAx3h8PkZFsBjWUcG2yZ7DcArpFuKkejbg","price":1,"primarySaleHappened":0,"properties":{"category":"image","creators":[{"address":"GdZVjytyPZv1jJA34rRs4SwXZxg8wQ7mL5eT3REryWcV","share":80},{"address":"pjGKdt8s3N9ueMamYGjNLAU54nXSFUpxdhWnahKMbAV","share":15},{"address":"EEU8j8ypEUyuin2zRazQH3bHSUEqezRMz6CXvpU7LGiJ","share":5}],"files":[{"type":"image/jpg","uri":"https://arweave.net/k9O2sDPmh0MAGBDtIgrZyoa_CxLibH9LyzyomtQS5Hc?ext=jpg"}]},"propertyCategory":"image","rarity":{},"sellerFeeBasisPoints":500,"supply":1,"title":"Affine Transformations #91","tokenDelegateValid":false,"updateAuthority":"pjGKdt8s3N9ueMamYGjNLAU54nXSFUpxdhWnahKMbAV","v2":{"auctionHouseKey":"E8cU1WiRWjanGxmn96ewBgk9vPTcL6AEZ1t6F6fkgUWe","expiry":-1,"sellerReferral":"autMW8SgBkVYeBgqYiTuJZnkvDZMVU2MHJh9Jh7CSQ2"}}]
