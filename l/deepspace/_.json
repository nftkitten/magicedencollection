Clusters and large complexes of dark nebulae are associated with Giant Molecular Clouds. Isolated small dark nebulae are called Bok globules. Like other interstellar dust or material, things it obscures are only visible using radio waves in radio astronomy or infrared in infrared astronomy.\n\nFor processing this image, 1 hour 40 minutes of raw data obtained via Telescope Live were used.\n\nChannel combination: Luminance+RGB (obtained with broadband filters)\n\nShooting data: -Telescope: Takahashi FSQ-106ED -Camera: FLI PL16803 (Credits: Telescope Live) \n\nPost-processing softwares: DSS, Pixinsight, Adobe Photoshop 2022.","creators":[{"address":"J5JpwkUKhFiTBPS5yw5xduJkC1hcxyHRXV3iqUEK7wjp","share":100,"verified":1}],"escrowPubkey":"GUwqb6TMA53c1PciNGS9y11tKSV8env6Mjfd14DX28TQ","externalURL":"","id":"5BV4CM5Lms4F6cSYbJwqpXjQwfEHNVNGLYR7PWr5E2FY","img":"https://www.arweave.net/7XZwQaalRJyZmpwz73QN6UMJNA0yvSJ_owYi-HsRCkk?ext=PNG","mintAddress":"5vydxzuWME3cdvLZ5fgrt5f1AZRf6nNSvUHWFjnsFANz","onChainCollection":{},"owner":"J5JpwkUKhFiTBPS5yw5xduJkC1hcxyHRXV3iqUEK7wjp","price":0.8,"primarySaleHappened":0,"properties":{"category":"image","creators":[{"address":"J5JpwkUKhFiTBPS5yw5xduJkC1hcxyHRXV3iqUEK7wjp","share":100,"verified":true}],"files":[{"type":"image/png","uri":"https://www.arweave.net/5adShyIwGJcD7sRbmx-OL0hAaLSuwiVnoKhhfJPkjcM?ext=PNG"}]},"propertyCategory":"image","rarity":{},"sellerFeeBasisPoints":500,"supply":1,"title":"Be142 Dark Nebula","tokenDelegateValid":false,"updateAuthority":"J5JpwkUKhFiTBPS5yw5xduJkC1hcxyHRXV3iqUEK7wjp","v2":{"auctionHouseKey":"E8cU1WiRWjanGxmn96ewBgk9vPTcL6AEZ1t6F6fkgUWe","expiry":-1,"sellerReferral":"autMW8SgBkVYeBgqYiTuJZnkvDZMVU2MHJh9Jh7CSQ2"}},{"attributes":[{"trait_type":"Channel Distribution: ","value":"SHO"},{"trait_type":"Filters:","value":"Narrowband"},{"trait_type":"Object Type: ","value":"HII Region"},{"trait_type":"Total Exposure Time: ","value":"\u003e 5 Hours"}],"collectionName":"deepspace","collectionTitle":"Solana Space Program","content":"Sh2-132 (Sharpless 2-132) is a large visible emission nebula (HII region) in the constellation of Cepheus.\nIt is located on the southern edge of the constellation, a short distance from the border with the Lizard, along the plane of the Milky Way.\n\nAn HII region is a region in space composed mainly by ionized hydrogen, which has the responsibility of the spectacular colors and shapes.

The galaxy's name stems from the area of Earth's sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which itself is named after the Ethiopian princess who was the wife of Perseus in Greek mythology. Around the year 964, the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi was the first to formally describe the Andromeda Galaxy. He referred to it in his \u003cBook of Fixed Stars\u003e as a \"nebulous smear\" or \"small cloud\". The mass of Andromeda, as the mass of the Milky Way, is difficult to estimate with any accuracy, but it was long thought that the Andromeda Galaxy is more massive than the Milky Way by a margin of some 25% to 50%. The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are expected to collide in around 4-5 billion years, merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy or a large lenticular galaxy.
