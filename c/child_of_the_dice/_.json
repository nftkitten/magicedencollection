Each Child has a different skin colour represented by their bark, breadth, and absorption. Like every other Child (or at least most of them), they have organs represented by their roots, hidden under their skins just like humans. One could even argue that these Children, even as trees, are far more advanced than humans! They live longer, up to an astonishing 13,000 years, like the Jurupa Oak or the Pando. It is vital in the face of a storm or other major weather events, it is not harmful to the planet, but on the contrary, it is beneficial. As with everything in life, sturdiness and stubbornness are required to bend without breaking while still being flexible and open-minded allows survival for a longer time. This particular Child represents the entire tree community, making it the guardian of immeasurable strength, wisdom and stability. Its objective is teaching, enlightenment and truth.

Their way of life is simple, intuitive, and spontaneous. If people need assistance, help, or even a tiny push in the right direction, and the Council deems it justified, one of the Silent Foxes is assigned to assist in their goal. The Child's task is simple: achieve the goal or pay for its failure in blood. However, Silent Foxes can also be savage and reactionary. The Silent Foxes consider the man not superior but equal to the animal. They live in harmony with the planet, simplicity, and humility. If you are not connected with the planet, they will never extend their help; you can even risk terrible retribution if you disrupt the natural order of the planet! Contrary to Silent Foxes assisting and helping, in their reactionary state to what the Council deems as evil, the Silent Foxes will impulsively in a larger group do what is necessary to avoid this situation from taking place or work towards mitigating the consequences."},"count":1,"floor":23000000000},{"attribute":{"trait_type":"Story","value":"This power is called the \"wink of death.\" Whenever the Child closes its right eye, it focuses on the soul, sucks the soul out of the person, and locks the soul away in a prison of fire. When the Child is feeling extra vicious, he takes the chained and locked soul and plunges it into a lava sea of sin to disperse the soul into the bottomless depths and guarantee that the soul fragments can never be put together. This ensures that the soul is lost forever. Due to its impenetrable armour, the Child cannot die… at least its body cannot. Its soul has already been dead for millennia. This Child is infectious and fearful; every Child he meets passes to the other side of the barrier and becomes evil incarnate. As impactful as it seems, other Children could undo this Child's evil only to a certain extent.

The Child is potent and very patient to allow mortals to find their way to be good to one another. The Child understands the need for mortals to develop. The Child's true power comes from its mitre and robe. This true power is their intelligence, knowledge, confidence, compassion, artistic interest, universal depth, well-being and serenity, skills, convictions, and presence.

The Child will determine which species are the most wholesome and redeemable and allow malignant creatures to fade out. It is the vault of life and balance; it is the continuity of life.

When he observes future events and their consequences, they are essential missions for preserving the end of civilization of the Children, of their planet, of science, and technology. When he travels to the future on missions, he rarely intervenes; the Children have a lot of backsliding and understand the dangers and inconveniences that an intervention could cause. He will, therefore, only observe the future and take the necessary actions back to the present to modify the course of an event naturally.

Fortunately, the Children got their hands on it and deactivated its destructive function just before it dangerously approached the Milky Way! It has a consciousness that has been reactivated by deactivating its weapon and showing the depth of love and art. As the harmful aspects have been neutralized, the Child is now part of their big family.
