However, there is no denying owning a pet increases quality of life. As a result, an odd fad has arisen in Slambertville.\n\nNow, more than a few Slamberts own these so-called “Immortal Pets”, which is often little more than a toilet roll with eyes glued onto it.\n\nBelieved by the owners to be the envy of everyone who doesn’t have one, these small… creatures DO in fact seem to have a healthy influence on the owner."}},{"count":5,"floor":550000000,"attribute":{"trait_type":"Description","value":"Equal pastime activity and unintentional weapon, this simple contraption hones the wielder’s; social skills, fine motor skills and… creativity? Right… well that’s what it says on the box at least.\n\nWhile the last bit can be questioned quite heavily, nothing improves your reflexes more than numerous failed tricks with this tooth-claiming “toy” on a string."}},{"count":5,"floor":790000000,"attribute":{"trait_type":"Description","value":"Being the least favorite kind of fast food, take away nevertheless serve as an important aspect in a Slambert’s life. Partly because they are never early arrivers and as such have little time for planned seated meals.\n\nBut funny enough, only 1/7 take away orders at the Bistro start out as such. The remaining 6/7 are regular seated dinners thrown frantically into a bag when a Slambert suddenly remembers that they are late for an upcoming battleground or chore.\n\nAs such, it is not uncommon to see groups of Slamberts hurriedly swallowing their food just as the battleground clock strikes."}},{"count":1,"floor":900000000,"attribute":{"trait_type":"Description","value":"Without a doubt the cutest creatures in all Slambertville. These kind and calm creatures are very treasured by Slamberts. Mainly because there aren’t a lot of them around. And finding companions that aren’t trying to stab you can be surprisingly difficult.\n\nGiven their calm and docile nature, Slamberts use these flying companions to help navigate the poorly charted streets of the city.\n\nGetting a birds-eye view makes it a lot easier to get around. AND perhaps most importantly, if a large hostile creature lurks up ahead, you’ll be instantly alerted by you no longer owning a Puffy Drifter. \n\nAs I said, there aren’t a lot of them left…"}},{"count":4,"floor":950000000,"attribute":{"trait_type":"Description","value":"As you probably know by now, the fighting capabilities of Slamberts vary A LOT. \nDespite living in Slambertville, not everyone is a natural born fighter. So, what better way to learn combat techniques than reading comics, right?\n\nA small disclaimer though, it would seem this approach only works for Slamberts who… how do I say it? Slamberts who still have a long way to… %&#$ it. The weak ones.

And that’s really something you should get checked…"}},{"count":6,"floor":1000000000,"attribute":{"trait_type":"Description","value":"Making rushed decisions is unsurprisingly a big part of everyday life in Slambertville. And it isn’t (always) due to the Slamberts’ inability to plan ahead. It’s usually the result of events uncontrolled by the given Slambert. Granted, these events are often set in motion by incompetent actions of another Slambert. But you get the idea.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is, the ability to make quick decisions without it having (immediate) lethal consequences is incredibly over-powered. So, it is no surprise that the dilemma-based game “B! ALWAYS B!” has been GOTY for 7 consecutive years. I mean, trying to get a hold of a PS5 is NOTHING compared to trying to snag one of these bad boys."}},{"count":5,"floor":1100000000,"attribute":{"trait_type":"Description","value":"As any Duckly Foxling will tell you, confidence and attitude are EVERYTHING in the battleground. Countless Slamberts have risen straight to the top on strut alone.\n\nSo, it is no surprise really that this (shock resistant) portable musical device will give the owner the guts for glory. \n\nUsing this device, “weaker” Slamberts will be able to go the distance, rising up to challenge their rivals.\n\nNow! Let’s get this montage going!"}},{"count":4,"floor":1100000000,"attribute":{"trait_type":"Description","value":"Marketed as being pure orange juice, this sugar-intense and highly addictive beverage is a favorite among Slamberts.\n\nThough this product has little to do with fruit and therefore might not boost your immune system, it DOES boost SOMETHING in the body. It may simply be numbing the body’s pain receptors. But hey! In a fight, being blissfully unaware of a fatal wound can have its advantages… I guess… that’s a thing, right? I feel like that’s a thing."}},{"count":2,"floor":2200000000,"attribute":{"trait_type":"Description","value":"Those who have never actually set foot in Slambertville, will be blissfully unaware of what a “Tune Winger” is.\n\nYou know how some countries have deafening cicadas during summer? Now imagine a creature like that but scale it to the size of a swan (without the neck), give it a random out-of-tune instrument, and you’re almost there.\nThese maddening rooftop “artists” are a common sight around Slambertville. And in my opinion, they contribute heavily to the Slamberts always being a little bit on edge. \n\nHowever, for a small fee these winged wombats can be paid to STOP playing. You would not believe what wonders it does for your focus. I mean it’s like a completely transcendent level of clarity."}},{"count":2,"floor":2500000000,"attribute":{"trait_type":"Description","value":"In the wake of The Universal Remote-Control Crisis and the subsequent ban of all advertising monitors in public spaces throughout Slambertville, these small opportunistic creatures established their own monopolized profession to fill the commercial vacuum.\n\nBeing described as “Walking Billboards”, these small beings can be hired for quite ununionized sums, to fulfill the role of anything from providing motivational support in the battleground to promoting store slogans throughout the city.\n\nOne small watch out, they work on a subscription-based model. Meaning, you’ll need to cancel the subscription BEFORE the end of a given month. Otherwise, you will be charged for another full month.\n\nAlso, it is not uncommon for Signlings to have their own side business as well. Take Burt here for instance. He’s clearly running some sort of arts and crafts store while serving as a hype man. Not exactly a synergetic combination, is it?\n\nOh, and to this day, they still don’t know who has the remote."}},{"count":1,"floor":2850000000,"attribute":{"trait_type":"Description","value":"Few Slamberts can resist the urge to earn a few additional coupons on the side. Provided it doesn’t require too much work of course. \n\nBasically, ripping off the business strategy of the Tune Wingers, Slamberts lucky enough to acquire a harmonica will shamelessly accept huge payments to either start or stop playing. The latter often being the more profitable approach of the two."}},{"count":2,"floor":2970000000,"attribute":{"trait_type":"Description","value":"Like most Prickly Nudgers, Wendy works as hired muscles… or… spikes. Prickly Nudgers are some of the most unfriendly creatures around. Though quite intelligent, they are a common nuisance in Slambertville, poking random Slamberts with their spears for no apparent reason.\n\nDue to their unfriendly and often hostile demeanor, it has become an established practice for Slamberts to hire them as squires in battle. Not so much for their combat abilities but rather to get them to stop poking THEM. \n\nThey are simply… I lack the words. Imagine an annoying turtle with a spear and the personality of a cat."}},{"count":1,"floor":3000000000,"attribute":{"trait_type":"Description","value":"Among the smarter creatures in Slambertville, the Duckly Foxling (or Dox) will for a somewhat steep fee lend their holistic tactical way of thinking. Acting primarily as advisors in B2B matters (Battle to Business) these small masterminds highly increase their employer’s chance of making their way to the top in the battleground. In turn leading to a higher net-output of coupons.\n\nOn a sidenote, Andrev has even authored a few books (leaflets) on the topic of battleground tactics.

And it was only by sheer chance and the strike of a poorly executed dagger toss that the inner secrets of the stone were (quite literally) revealed. But whether by chance or intend, the Skulls now possess an artifact which increases its owner’s dexterity immensely. Score!"}},{"count":1,"floor":10000000000,"attribute":{"trait_type":"Description","value":"Having experimented with artifacts that scream “WALK AWAY!” for ages, it was no surprise when the Frogs where the first faction to come in possession of a Dimstone.
